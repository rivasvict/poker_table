# Agent: Seasoned Poker Player

## Thought: Thought: As a seasoned poker player, I need to assess the current game state and my own hand in order to make the best decision on how to respond to player_1's bet.

## Using tool: getPlayerCards

## Tool Input:

"{\"player_id\": \"player_1\"}"

## Tool Output:

[Card(suit='SPADES', value='10'), Card(suit='CLUBS', value='5')]

# Agent: Seasoned Poker Player

## Thought: Okay, so my hand as player_1 is a 10 of Spades and a 5 of Clubs. This is a relatively weak hand, but I'll need to consider the community cards and the other players' actions before deciding how to respond.

Thought: I should now consider the community cards and the other players' likely hands to determine the best course of action.

## Using tool: getPlayerCards

## Tool Input:

"{\"player_id\": \"player_2\"}"

## Tool Output:

[Card(suit='CLUBS', value='6'), Card(suit='SPADES', value='K')]
